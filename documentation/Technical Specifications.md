### API Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication:** Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Users must authenticate via the `/api/auth/login` endpoint to receive a token, which must be included in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`) for subsequent requests.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced. Admin-specific endpoints require users to have an 'admin' role.

### API Data Formats

All APIs communicate using JSON for both requests and responses to ensure consistency and ease of parsing across different platforms.

#### Example: User Registration

**Request:**

```
POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
    "username": "parentUser",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!",
    "email": "parent@example.com",
    "role": "parent"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "message": "Registration successful.",
    "user_id": 101
}
```

#### Example: Retrieve Puzzles

**Request:**

```
GET /api/puzzles
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "puzzles": [
        {
            "puzzle_id": 1,
            "image_url": "https://example.com/images/puzzle1.png",
            "theme": "Animals",
            "difficulty_level": 4
        },
        {
            "puzzle_id": 2,
            "image_url": "https://example.com/images/puzzle2.png",
            "theme": "Vehicles",
            "difficulty_level": 9
        }
    ]
}
```

### Error Handling

APIs will use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. Error responses will include a message detailing the issue.

| Status Code | Description                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 200         | OK - The request was successful.  |
| 201         | Created - The resource was created successfully. |
| 400         | Bad Request - The request was invalid or cannot be processed. |
| 401         | Unauthorized - Authentication failed or user lacks permissions. |
| 403         | Forbidden - The user does not have access rights to the content. |
| 404         | Not Found - The requested resource could not be found. |
| 500         | Internal Server Error - A generic error occurred on the server. |

**Example: Unauthorized Access**

**Response:**

```json
{
    "error": "Unauthorized",
    "message": "Authentication token is missing or invalid."
}
```

### API Rate Limiting

To ensure system stability and prevent abuse, rate limiting will be implemented as follows:

| User Type      | Endpoint Type           | Limit                     |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **General Users** | All Internal APIs      | 100 requests per minute   |
| **Admin Users**   | All Internal APIs      | 200 requests per minute   |
| **External Services** | AI Image Generation, Payment Processing | As per provider limits (e.g., Stripe, DALL-E) |

### API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation will be maintained using tools like Swagger or Postman Collections. Documentation will include:

- Endpoint URLs
- HTTP methods
- Request parameters and body schemas
- Response formats and examples
- Authentication methods
- Error codes and messages

**Example Documentation Snippet:**

{
    "purchase_id": 5001,
    "status": "successful",
    "receipt_url": "https://example.com/receipts/5001.pdf"
}
```

### API Security Measures

- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** All API communications are secured using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Input Validation:** All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Token Expiration:** JWT tokens have an expiration time to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Ensures that users can only access endpoints appropriate to their role (e.g., admin vs. parent).
- **Audit Logging:** All sensitive actions, especially those performed by admins, are logged for monitoring and auditing purposes.

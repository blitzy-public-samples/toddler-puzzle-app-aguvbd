# Deployment Instructions

To deploy the infrastructure using Terraform, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Ensure **Terraform** (version >= 0.12) is installed on your machine.
   - Install AWS CLI and configure it with appropriate credentials.
   - Verify that you have access to deploy resources in the desired AWS account.

   <!--
   Dependency on Terraform version >= 0.12 is specified in the external dependencies. Refer to "dependencies.external" in the JSON specification.
   -->

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/toddler-puzzle-app.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Terraform Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd toddler-puzzle-app/infrastructure/terraform
   ```

4. **Initialize Terraform:**

   Initialize the workspace and download required providers and modules.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. **Select Environment Variables:**

   Choose the appropriate environment variable file (`dev.tfvars` or `prod.tfvars`) located in `infrastructure/terraform/environments/`.

6. **Review the Terraform Plan:**

   Generate and review the execution plan to understand the resources that will be created.

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
   ```

7. **Apply the Terraform Configuration:**

   Deploy the infrastructure.

   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted.

8. **Post-Deployment Verification:**

   - Check the **outputs** defined in `outputs.tf` for essential information like endpoint URLs and resource IDs.
   - Verify the deployed resources in the AWS Management Console.

<!--
These deployment steps address requirements in TR-8.1 and TR-8.2 from "Feature 8: Regular Updates" in the Technical Specification, ensuring seamless integration and deployment of new content.
-->

# Management and Maintenance

Proper management and maintenance of the infrastructure are crucial for the application's reliability and performance.

- **Updating Infrastructure:**

  - Modify configurations in `variables.tf` or environment-specific `.tfvars` files for scaling or updating resources.
  - Re-run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to apply changes.

- **Scaling Resources:**

  - Adjust instance sizes, desired counts, and autoscaling policies in the ECS and EC2 modules based on application load.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**

  - Utilize **CloudWatch dashboards** set up in `cloudwatch.tf` for real-time monitoring.
  - Set up alarms and notifications for critical metrics.

- **Security Patches and Updates:**

  - Regularly update AMIs and container images to include the latest security patches.
  - Review IAM policies in `iam.tf` to enforce the principle of least privilege.

<!--
Management practices align with TR-5.2 and TR-11.4 from the Technical Specification, focusing on resource scaling and performance optimization.
-->

# Backup and Recovery

Implementing a robust backup and recovery strategy ensures data integrity and quick restoration in case of failures.

- **Automated Backups:**

  - RDS instances are configured with automatic backups.
  - S3 versioning is enabled for critical data buckets.

- **Backup Script:**

  - Use the `backup.sh` script located in `infrastructure/scripts/backup.sh` to manually trigger backups of configurations and state files.

  ```bash
  ./scripts/backup.sh
  ```

- **Restoration Process:**

  - In case of data loss, restore RDS snapshots and S3 objects from backups.
  - Use Terraform state files from backups to recover infrastructure states.

<!--
Backup and recovery procedures fulfill TR-4.2 and TR-10.5, ensuring data synchronization and integrity as specified in the Technical Specification.
-->

# Destruction Instructions

To safely destroy all infrastructure resources:

1. **Navigate to the Terraform Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd toddler-puzzle-app/infrastructure/terraform
   ```

2. **Review Destruction Plan:**

   ```bash
   terraform plan -destroy -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
   ```

3. **Execute Destruction:**

   Run the `destroy.sh` script to automate the process.

   ```bash
   ./scripts/destroy.sh
   ```

   Or manually execute:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted.

4. **Post-Destruction Verification:**

   - Ensure all resources are deleted by checking the AWS Management Console.
   - Remove any residual state files if necessary.

<!--
Destruction instructions are critical for resource cleanup and cost management, addressing TR-8.5 from "Feature 8: Regular Updates" regarding efficient updates and resource handling.

  - Terraform state is configured using `backend.tf` to store state files remotely, facilitating team collaboration.

- **Providers Configuration:**

  - The `providers.tf` file specifies the AWS provider and its configurations.

    ```hcl
    provider "aws" {
      region = var.aws_region
    }
    ```

- **Variables and Outputs:**

  - Define global variables in `variables.tf`.
  - Output important information using `outputs.tf` for ease of access post-deployment.

- **Environment Configurations:**

  - Use `dev.tfvars` and `prod.tfvars` to manage environment-specific settings.
  - Ensure sensitive data like access keys are managed securely and not hard-coded.

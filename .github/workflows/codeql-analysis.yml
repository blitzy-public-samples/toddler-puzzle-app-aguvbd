# CodeQL Analysis Workflow for the Toddler Puzzle App
# Automates code scanning to identify vulnerabilities and ensure code quality using CodeQL.
# Addresses Requirement: 'Code Quality and Security Analysis'
# Location: Technical Specification/Development Practices/Code Quality

name: CodeQL Analysis

# Trigger the workflow on push and pull request events to 'main' and 'develop' branches
# Ensures continuous integration and code quality checks on key branches
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "develop" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main", "develop" ]

# Define the job to perform CodeQL analysis
jobs:
  codeql-analysis:
    name: CodeQL Analysis
    # Run the job on the latest Ubuntu environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Set permissions for the job to upload results to the security tab
    permissions:
      actions: read        # Allows reading other actions
      contents: read       # Allows reading repository contents
      security-events: write  # Allows writing security analysis results

    # Steps to execute within the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # Uses GitHub's checkout action to clone the repository
      # External Dependency: GitHub Actions 'actions/checkout@v3' (version 'v3')
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      # Uses setup-node action to install Node.js version 16.x
      # External Dependency: GitHub Actions 'actions/setup-node@v3' (version 'v3')
      # Addresses global Node.js version requirement for consistency across CI processes
      # Internal Dependency: Shares environment settings as configured in 'ci.yml'
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'  # Global node_version specified in technical specifications

      # Step 3: Initialize CodeQL
      # Uses GitHub's CodeQL action to prepare for analysis
      # External Dependency: CodeQL 'github/codeql-action/init@v2' (version 'v2')
      # Configures CodeQL for JavaScript and TypeScript analysis as per the codebase languages
      - name: Initialize CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
        with:
          languages: 'javascript, typescript'

      # Step 4: Run CodeQL analysis
      # Performs the analysis and uploads results to GitHub Security tab
      # External Dependency: CodeQL 'github/codeql-action/analyze@v2' (version 'v2')
      # Addresses the need to automate code scanning for vulnerabilities
      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2

# Notes:
# - This workflow depends on environment settings and secrets defined in 'ci.yml' and 'cd.yml' for consistency
# - Internal Dependencies:
#   - '.github/workflows/ci.yml': Shares environment settings and secrets for CI processes
#   - '.github/workflows/cd.yml': Shares deployment secrets and configurations
# - External Dependencies:
#   - GitHub Actions (actions), Version: 'v3' (latest)
#   - CodeQL (github/codeql-action), Version: 'v2' (latest)
